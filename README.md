# MXTracker - Automotive Maintenance Tracking Application for iOS

MXTracker is an iOS application that helps users track maintenance tasks performed on their vehicles. The app supports unlimited vehicle and maintenance record entries using CoreData, ensuring smooth data management.

## Features

- **Multiple Vehicle Tracking**: Add and manage maintenance records for any number of vehicles
- **Maintenance Notifications**: Set up notifications for maintenance tasks based on specified service intervals to never miss a due date
- **Local Store Finder**: Easily search for nearby automotive parts stores to find any parts you need (or broke, or forgot to buy!)
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - **Export Functionality**: Enhance the credibility of vehicle maintenance records with an export feature that generates a detailed PDF of a vehicle's service history. This functionality not only documents the specific maintenance tasks performed but also records the exact date and time each entry was added to the application. This level of detail helps sellers prove the authenticity of their maintenance history and enables buyers to verify the timing of entries, helping to identify maintenance performed at regular service intervals. This feature will be particularly valuable in establishing trust and transparency in the vehicle buying/selling process.
  - **Cost Tracking**: Include fields for logging cost of parts and storing receipts or photos as proof of purchase/proof of work performed.
  - **Expanded Vehicle Year Range**: Improve vehicle year range support to accommodate older models.

## Acknowledgments

I developed MXTracker during an iOS development class at Arizona State University. As someone who maintains their own vehicles, I recognized the need for a centralized, accessible tool to manage maintenance records. This app is designed to help fellow enthusiasts keep track of their vehicle's maintenance history in one place, plan future maintenance easily, and maintain accurate service intervals.
